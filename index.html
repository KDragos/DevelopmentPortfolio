				<ul>
					<li>A Google Tango game, currently in Beta on the Play store. I designed the game with incremental delivery in mind toward the goal of creating a first person role playing game. Players will have to attack enemies, dodge their attacks, and progress through storylines to succeed. (Project Tango, Unity, C#, Git, Gitlab) </li>
					<li>Current Features: The current beta features randomly spawning enemies who target players when they are within a certain range of the enemy. Players are able to attack and kill enemies, dodge enemy attacks and heal themselves if they take damage. Players also gain experience and level up as they kill enemies.</li>

			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<img src="images/profilepic.png" alt="Kristin Dragos">
			<p>I grew up in Illinois and moved to Arizona in 2013. I have a BA in English with a minor in Psychology from Western Illinois University. Recently, I discovered my desire to turn my love of technology into a career.</p>
			<p>In my previous life, I was a cosmetologist for 6 years and a teacher. I taught 4th and 5th grade students, as well as held various tutoring positions. In each of these roles I strived to bring technology into the classroom to individualize my teaching and engage my students. At the schools where I taught, I started and supervised a computer coding club for 5th graders that used Scratch from MIT, and supervised a FIRST Lego Robotics League for middle school students. It is through these clubs that I realized I wanted to do more with technology. In January 2015, I made the decision to attend Rockit Bootcamp in Tempe, Arizona. This 12 week immersive course had me working 40-60 hours per week on learning and practicing web development skills.</p>
			<p>In May 2016, I attended the Google I/O conference in Mountain View, CA. During that conference, I was inspired to start learning how to create virtual and augmented reality apps with Google's Tango technology. Since then, I've started working on my own projects including <a href="http://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.DragonSansCache.FracturePreludeV1">Fracture Break.</a> I'm looking forward to learning and creating more!</a></p>
