			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<img src="images/profilepic.png" alt="Kristin Dragos">
			<p>I grew up in Illinois and only recently moved to Arizona. I'm married to an amazing guy and have a son. I have a BA in English from Western Illinois University. Recently, I discovered my desire to turn my love of technology into a career.</p>
			<p>In my previous life, I was a cosmetologist for 6 years and a teacher. I taught 4th and 5th grade students, as well as held various tutoring positions. In each of these roles I strived to bring technology into the classroom to individualize my teaching and engage my students. At the schools where I taught, I started and supervised a computer coding club for 5th graders that used Scratch from MIT, and supervised a FIRST Lego Robotics League for middle school students. It is through these clubs that I realized I wanted to do more with technology. In January 2015, I made the decision to attend Rockit Bootcamp in Tempe, Arizona. This 12 week immersive course had me working 40-60 hours per week on learning and practicing web development skills.</p>
